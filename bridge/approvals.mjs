/**
 * The owner's Approve — the one place an "ask" from the gate waits for a yes.
 *
 * AYRA runs everything on the laptop herself except the four things the owner
 * chose to be asked about (gate.mjs ASK). When one of those comes up, the call
 * stops here until the owner answers on whichever screen is nearest — the
 * HUD's card, a spoken "yes", or the Telegram buttons; the first answer wins and
 * the others are told. No answer in two minutes is a no: an action nobody
 * approved never runs. The kill switch (`halt`) says no to everything waiting.
 *
 * "Always allow here" (allowances.mjs): an ask that names its place — a website,
 * an app — and is of the one kind that can be allowed ahead (sending or posting)
 * offers a third answer, `always`, and next time goes ahead without asking.
 *
 * Events to subscribers (HUD sockets, Telegram):
 *   { type: 'approve', id, channel, tool, reason, detail, always, at }  — please answer;
 *        `always` is the third button's words ("Always on linkedin.com") or ''
 *   { type: 'approved', id, ok, by, always }                    — answered (or timed out)
 *   { type: 'halt', by }                                        — the kill switch
 *
 * The audit log gets who answered what and why it was asked, never the detail:
 * a command line can carry anything.
