/**
 * The audit log — what AYRA was asked, what it tried, what the gate allowed.
 *
 * One JSON object per line in data/logs/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl (the owner's local
 * date), so a day's activity is one small file that any text editor opens and
 * any script can read. It exists for one question above all: "what did AYRA
 * do, and why was it allowed?" — which matters more every phase, as AYRA gets
 * hands.
 *
 * What is written: questions and answers (cut to a few hundred characters),
 * tool NAMES and the gate's verdicts, errors, session starts and ends. What is
 * never written: tool inputs (they can hold mail bodies or file contents),
 * environment values, tokens or keys. data/ is gitignored and stays here.
