/**
 * Background jobs — a task done start to finish on its own (PLAN.md 6.2).
 *
 * The owner, 2026-10-05: "if I say go to the x website and do some task and
 * open y website and do some task… it has to just perform it." A job is its own
 * conversation with the brain, so the HUD and Telegram stay free while it
 * works. One at a time.
 *
 * It has a budget — 30 minutes and 60 tool steps — because the owner's Claude
 * Pro limits are shared with their own use (CLAUDE.md, Terms); past it the job
 * is stopped and says how far it got. The owner hears on Telegram when it
 * starts, every few minutes while it runs, and when it ends — with a picture of
 * where it finished when the job took one. The ask-first list applies exactly
 * as everywhere else, and the kill switch stops it.
 *
 * The `ayra_jobs` tool server lets a conversation start one, ask how it is
 * going, and stop it. A job's own conversation is not given it: no jobs
 * inside jobs.
