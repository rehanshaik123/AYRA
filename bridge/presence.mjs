/**
 * "I'm back" — AYRA tells the owner when she was away (PLAN.md 6.4).
 *
 * The laptop is her home for now (the owner's answer 2a): she is reachable
 * from the phone only while it is on and awake. When it was off, asleep or
 * restarting for a while, messages sent meanwhile are answered late — so once
 * she is back she says so, once, with how long she was gone.
 *
 * A heartbeat in data/state.json (`aliveAt`) marks the last minute she was
 * up. A gap found at start-up means she was off or restarting; a gap between
 * two ticks of a running bridge means the laptop slept.
